To run train.py:
python train.py

Make sure to make two directories at the same level as train.py  : ./trainImages and ./testImages
Fill those directories with the amount of images required (200-300 for testing. For training, you can adjust the size in multiples of 200)

To run predict.py:
python predict.py ./predictImages/4.jpg ./predictImages/5.jpg 

For the images to predict, you can specify any file paths. I made a directory called predictImages but it isn't necessary.

_____________________________

To run imageDownloader.py:
python imageDownloader.py movie-genre-from-its-poster/MovieGenre.csv

The argument is the path to the IMDB csv file. 
As the same level as imageDownloader.py, create an ./images directory to store the downloaded images in (or change it to whatever directory name you want in the code)
